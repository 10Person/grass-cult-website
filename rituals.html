                    The rituals of the <em>The Grass Cult</em> are few in number but are still of great importance to our members.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The most important ritual of <em>The Grass Cult</em> is the <em>Holy Handshake of the Grass</em> in which 2 members hold each others hands in between their palms and thumbs, with the palms facing to the ground, and then shake them using their whole body.</li>
                        <li>The second most important ritual is the <em>The Unamed One</em> in which two people hold up their index fingers and move them side to side, hitting the other persons fingers.</li>
                    </ul>
